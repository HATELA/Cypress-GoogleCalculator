# Cypress-GoogleCalendar
This was a project to test out google calculator - Since we cannot test out the google calendar directly - we are testing out a different calculator service - https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/math/basic.php 

Restrictions:
Due to Googleâ€™s bot protection and CAPTCHA on search results, Cypress cannot reliably automate the live Google calculator page. 
We tried mimicing as real user, have waits, keyboard actions but google wont let us bypass the bot detection flow.
